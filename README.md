# UnityUIGrid

UnityUIGrid is a simple script using [Setchi's LineSegmentsIntersection](https://github.com/setchi/Unity-LineSegmentsIntersection) to enable a regular square grid or a phi grid (based on the Golden ratio). Once added to the canvas, all children of that canvas can be snapped onto intersections.

# Features
- Multiple grids (Golden Ratio, square grids & Rule of Thirds)
- Snapping
- Responsive to canvas size
